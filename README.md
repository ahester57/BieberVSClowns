# BieberVSClowns
You're in the middle of nowhere surrounded by people who you only kinda know.
What is this place?
  I can sing
  I can drink orange juice?
  I can call my friends?
Wait. Why am I Justin Beiber??

Oh dang there's an evil clown and his crew coming at me!

This project is my first *real* game made with JavaFX. I have 
a lot of experience with Java, but decided to learn JavaFX this
Spring. I built a few other applications with minor functionality,
but BeiberVSClowns combines concepts and pieces from its precursors.

src/ contains imgs/ and all the .java & .fxml files.

the other files are here because it's synced with my IDE.
